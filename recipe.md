RECIPE INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees (F). Prepare two 9-inch cake pans by spraying with baking spray or buttering and lightly flouring. 

FOR THE CHOCOLATE CAKE:

1. Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and espresso powder to a big bowl. Whisk this to combine the ingredients, until mixed well. 

2. Add milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to the flour mixture. Mix until the ingredients are well-combined. Carefully add boiling water to the cake batter until everything is mixed well. 

3. Distribute cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. 

4. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes, remove the cakes from the pans and cool completely. 

5. Frost the cake with the chocolate frosting (recipe for frosting is down below). 

FOR THE FROSTING:

1. Add cocoa to a large bowl. Whisk through to remove any lumps. 

2. Cream together the butter and cocoa powder until well-combined. 

3. Add sugar and milk to cocoa mixture by adding 1 cup of sugar, followed by about a tablespoon of milk. After each addition has been combined, mix these up in a fast pace for about a minute. Repeat until all sugar and milk have been added. 

4. Add vanilla extract and espresso powder and combine well.

5. If frosting appears too dry, add more milk, a tablespoon at a time until it reaches the right consistency. If it appears too wet, add more confectioner's sugar, a tablespoon at a time until it reaches the right consistency.
